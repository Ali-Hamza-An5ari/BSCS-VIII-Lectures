traditional vs cloud client-server model

traditionally servers makes internet infrastructure and responds on client requests. 

cloud computing server not only responds but also run program and store data on clients behalf

rather owning own computing infrastructure, companies can rent access to app or storage from cloud provider

avoid
-upfront cost
-complexity of owning and maintenace of infrastructure
-

cloud computing is equally beneficial for person in running
-apps
-storage
-develop and test programs

Advantages
-cost infrastructure, cooling, maintenance, expertise hire


-speed
pressure off capacity plannig
fast service

-global sccale 
scale elasticity
appropriate power and bandwidth

-productivity
cc excludes need of many tasks so IT team can focuse on imp business goals.

-reliability 
data backup, disaster recovery and business continuity easier because data is mirrored at multiple sites on cp network


Disadvantage
-companies reluctant to keep snsitive data ownself
-cc is not always cheaper
-if app has regular and predictible req then inhouse is more economical
-you can access if have internet connection
-large companies can be haccked


Five essential characteristics of cloud model
-On demand self service
-resource pooling
-rapid elasticity
-measure service
-broad network access
