6 Stages of computer security

Pacth

Patches are software and operating system (OS) updates that address security vulnerabilities within a program or product.

Critical important to cover the vulneribilities

--------------------------
Ports 

Shutting down unneeded ports and services is an essential and very basic part of computer security. As
mentioned above, every port open (and every service running) is a possible avenue for a hacker or virus
to get to your machine. Therefore, the rule is: If you don’t need it, shut it down and block it.
It is best for you to first make a list of all software that you are running. Then, look up the ports and
protocols that you will need for that software and allow only those. It is important to keep in mind that
these are ports for incoming traffic. If your machine is not used as a database server, web server, or other type of server and if your machine is a stand-alone one, you can (and should) close all ports.
Workstations on networks may need some ports open for network utilities. We will examine some
interesting utilities later in this chapter.
every port you can close is one less opportunity
for such attacks to affect your system.


--------------------------
Protect
The next phase of assessing a system’s security is to ensure that all reasonable protective software and
devices are employed. This means, at a minimum, a firewall between your network and the outside
world.

You should also consider using an intrusion-detection
system (IDS) on that firewall and any web servers

The firewall and IDS will
provide basic security to your network’s perimeter, but you also need virus scanning.

consider antispyware software on all of your systems. This will prevent users of
your network from inadvertently running spyware on the network.

--------------------------
Policies

organization have clearly written policies on
computer security—and that those policies be strongly enforced by management. Those policies
should cover acceptable use of organizational computers, the Internet, email, and any other aspect of
the system.


>>>>>>>> Policies should prohibit the installation of any software on the systems. Only IT personnel
should install software and only after they have verified its safety.

>>>>>>>Different data access


>>>>>>>>There should be a policy regarding passwords: acceptable minimum length, lifetime of a password,
password history, and passwords to be avoided, such as any word that has a direct connection to the
user like family names, fullname, countryname etc. 


>>>>>>>> Password replacement schedule of 90 days


>>>>>>>> Policies includes specific instruction of What to do in case of employee termination like person’s login accounts should be disabled immedieately and physical access should discontinued. 
--------------------------

Probing for certain time like 3 months or year from securuty auditors

probing your ports a review of your security policies, your patching system, any security
logs you maintain, personnel files of those in secure positions, and so forth.

-----------------------

Physical


>>>>>>>> policy or procedure governing the
locking of rooms with computers as well as the handling of laptops, PDAs, and other mobile computer
devices.


>>>>>>>> Backup tapes should be stored in a fireproof safe. Documents and old backup tapes
should be destroyed before disposal


>>>>>>>> Physical access to routers and hubs should also be tightly controlled

Basic rules for Physical security
Server rooms: server logs and keys
