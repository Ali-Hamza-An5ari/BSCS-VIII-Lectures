VM are slow and take time to boot

Containers are fast and boot quickly, dont waste host resources

Containers are handled by containerization engine 

Docker is contzation platform to create and run container

Container is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Comparison of VM and docker

-Size: resources theey utiliize wastes memory
-Startup: boot time guest OS needs to start from scrtch and load all bins and libs

On Vm 2 different VM need to run different versions of same language Ruby 

On Docker, 2 different containers needed on host PC, it will download libs and bins itself. 


-Integration: integration with other tools


Docker Engine installed app on host machine. 

server long running daemon process
CLI client

communication with REST API

Doccker image is building block of Docker container. 
You can create a new docker image or use from docker-hub 
docker always runs softwares


Docker container 
ready apps created from dock images, have all required package to run the application. 

Docker registery 
storage where docker images are stored, can be local or public where users can collaborate.

Docekr architecture
includes

-client to triger commands
-host runs daemon
-resgitery store images



Docker File 
contains instructions to build docker image
-ht run commands
-add files
-cr env variables
-process to run 

result is docker image

Docker compose 
tool for defining and running multi-container app with docker in a single file. ensures fast and easy development.

Docker Swarm is native clustering system have multiple docker daemons which distibute workloads
